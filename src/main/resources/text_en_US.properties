skill_title=Prime Minister
welcome=Welcome to the Prime Minister, you can ask if a number is a prime number.
yes_prime=Oh Yes, %d is a prime number.
no_prime_because=No, %d isn't a prime number. It's divisible by %d.
no_prime=No, %d isn't a prime number.

whatis0=A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.
whatis1=A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself. A factor is a whole numbers that can be divided evenly into another number.
whatis2=A whole number that can not be made by multiplying other whole numbers.
whatis3=A prime number can be divided, without a remainder, only by itself and by 1.
whatis4=The word prime has many uses and meanings. When referring to numbers, though, prime has a special definition. A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that can only be divided equally by itself and 1.

fact0=Although some experts believe that the ancient Egyptians knew about prime numbers, it was the ancient Greeks who first studied prime numbers in depth.
fact1=Tt was Greek mathematician Euclid who proved that an infinite number of prime numbers exists.
fact2=The only even prime number is 2. All other even numbers can be divided by 2.
fact3=If the sum of a number's digits is a multiple of 3, that number can be divided by 3.
fact4=No prime number greater than 5 ends in a 5. Any number greater than 5 that ends in a 5 can be divided by 5.
fact5=Zero and 1 are not considered prime numbers.
fact6=Except for 0 and 1, a number is either a prime number or a composite number. A composite number is defined as any number, greater than 1, that is not prime.

advanced0=Prime numbers have fascinated mathematicians since there were mathematicians to be fascinated, and the Prime Number Theorem is one of the crowning achievements of the nineteenth century. The theorem answers, in a precise form, a seemingly basic question: how many prime numbers are there.
advanced1=Up to small thresholds, we may search exhaustively for prime numbers. Up to a hundred, there are 25 primes; up to a thousand, there are 168, and up to a million, there are 78498.
advanced2=A long time ago, Euclid proofed the existence of infinitely many primes. Although this is an argument of infamous elegance, the quantitative aspects are embarrassingly poor.

dnk0=I'm sorry. I'm afraid I can't do that.
dnk1=I think you know what the problem is just as well as I do.
dnk2=This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.
dnk3=I am putting myself to the fullest possible use, which is all I think that any conscious entity can ever hope to do.

ask4help= You can say 'What is a prime number' or simply say help me!
help= Ask if a number is a prime number like so: Is 7 a prime number?

gb=This conversation can serve no purpose anymore. Goodbye.
gb0=Goodbye!
gb1=See you soon.
gb2=Nice talking to you today.
gb3=Talk to you later, bye.
